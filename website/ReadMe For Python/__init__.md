# 🌟 **Flask Application Setup Script**

Welcome to the **Flask Application Setup Script**! This script provides the foundational setup for a Flask web application, managing the configuration and registering blueprints for different parts of the application.

---

## 📝 **Features**

- **Application Factory**: A clean and scalable way to create and configure Flask application instances.
- **Blueprint Registration**: Modular management of different application components via Flask blueprints.
- **Session Security**: Enhanced security through the use of a secret key for session management.

---

## 🛠️ **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/flask-app-setup.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed, then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

---

## 🚀 **Usage**

### **Create and Configure the Flask Application**

Use the `create_app` function to create and configure your Flask application instance.

```python
from your_package import create_app

app = create_app('your-secret-key')
```

### **Run the Application**

After creating the app instance, you can run your Flask application.

```bash
flask run
```

---

## 🧠 **How It Works**

1. **Creating the Flask Application**:  
   The script starts by creating a new Flask application instance using the `Flask` class.

   ```python
   app = Flask(__name__)
   ```

2. **Importing and Registering Blueprints**:

   - The `views` and `auth` blueprints are imported from their respective modules.
   - These blueprints are registered with the Flask application instance, each handling different parts of the application.

   ```python
   from .views import views
   from .auth import auth

   app.register_blueprint(views, url_prefix='/')
   app.register_blueprint(auth, url_prefix='/')
   ```

3. **Setting the Secret Key**:

   - The secret key is crucial for session management and securing the application. It is set using the `app.secret_key` attribute.

   ```python
   app.secret_key = key
   ```

4. **Returning the Configured Application**:  
   Finally, the fully configured Flask application instance is returned, ready to be used to serve your application.

   ```python
   return app
   ```

## 📚 **Dependencies**

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Secret Key**: Make sure to use a strong and unique secret key for your application to ensure session security.
- **Blueprints**: The `views` and `auth` modules should define the Flask blueprints that handle different routes and functionalities.
