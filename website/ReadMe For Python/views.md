# 🎨 **Views Blueprint - Flask Application** 🎨

Welcome to the **Views Blueprint** of our Flask application! This file is responsible for rendering the core pages of our app, starting with the **home page**. Here's a quick overview of what happens in this simple yet powerful part of our application:

## 🌟 **Overview**

The `views.py` file defines a Flask Blueprint named `views`, dedicated to handling the main routes that render HTML templates. This is where we set up the **home page** of our application, offering users a welcoming landing point.

### 📦 **Dependencies**

- **Flask Modules:**
  - 🧩 `Blueprint`: Used to group the view-related routes together.
  - 🖼️ `render_template`: Renders the HTML templates for our pages.

### 🎨 **Blueprint Configuration**

- **Blueprint Definition:**
  - `views = Blueprint('views', __name__)`: This line creates a new Blueprint named `views` for organizing the routes that render our application's views.

### 🏠 **Route: Home**

- **Route:** `/`
- **Methods:** `GET`
- **Description:**
  - **Purpose:** This route handles the rendering of the **home page**.
  - **Function:** The `home()` function simply returns the rendered `home.html` template, providing users with the main entry point to our application.

### 🗂️ **Templates**

- **Home Page:** `home.html`
  - This template is the heart of the home route and is what users will see when they visit the base URL of our application.

## 🎯 **Summary**

The `views.py` file is where the core views of our application are defined. By using Flask's Blueprint, we keep these routes **organized** and **modular**, ensuring that the main pages of our application are easily maintained and extended.
