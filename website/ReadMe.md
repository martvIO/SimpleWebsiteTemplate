### 📁 `/static`

- **Purpose**: Stores static assets such as CSS files, JavaScript files, images, and other media.
- **Subfolders**:
  - `/css`: Contains stylesheet files.
  - `/js`: Contains JavaScript files.
  - `/images`: Contains image files used in the application.
  - `/other_assets`: Contains other static files like custom fonts.

### 📁 `/templates`

- **Purpose**: Contains HTML templates used for rendering web pages. These templates are dynamically populated with content by Flask.
- **Files**:
  - `login.html`: Template for the login page.
  - `sign_up.html`: Template for the sign-up page.
  - `any_other_page.html`: Template for other pages in the application.

### 📁 `/ReadMe For Python`

- **Purpose**: Provides documentation for the Python scripts in the project. Each file in this folder corresponds to a Python script in the project and includes details about the script's functionality and usage.
- **Files**:
  - `[python_file_name].md`: Documentation file for the Python script named `[python_file_name].py`. Replace `[python_file_name]` with the actual name of the Python file.

### 📄 `app.py`

- **Purpose**: Initializes the Flask application instance and runs the application. It includes configuration settings and the main entry point for the application.

### 📄 `views.py`

- **Purpose**: Defines the routes and view functions for the Flask application. It handles requests, processes data, and renders templates.

### 📄 `models.py`

- **Purpose**: Contains data models and database interactions. Defines the structure of the database and provides methods for querying and manipulating data.

### 📄 `README.md`

- **Purpose**: This file provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and other relevant information.

## 📜 `ReadMe For Python` Folder

The `ReadMe For Python` folder contains Markdown files that provide detailed explanations of each Python script in the project. Each file is named to match its corresponding Python script and includes the following information:

- **Purpose**: What the script does and its role in the project.
- **Usage**: How to run the script and any required parameters or configurations.
- **Functions/Classes**: Descriptions of the main functions and classes in the script.

### Example

If you have a Python file named `example_script.py`, you will find a corresponding `example_script.md` file in the `ReadMe For Python` folder. This Markdown file explains what `example_script.py` does, how to use it, and details about its functions and classes.
